# Event Ticket Booking System

## Overview
The Event Ticket Booking System is a Node.js application designed to manage event ticket bookings efficiently. It allows users to book tickets for various events, handle cancellations, and manage a waiting list when tickets are sold out. The application is built using **Express.js**, adheres to RESTful API principles, and follows best practices in error handling, concurrency management, and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Features
- **Event Initialization**: Initialize events with a specified number of available tickets.
- **Concurrent Booking**: Users can book tickets simultaneously, with thread-safety ensured for all operations.
- **Waiting List Management**: Users are added to a waiting list when tickets are sold out, and tickets are automatically assigned to waiting list users upon cancellations.
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Retrieve the current status of an event, including available tickets and waiting list count.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Meaningful error messages are provided for various edge cases.
- **In-Memory and RDBMS Support**: Data can be managed using in-memory storage or an RDBMS.

## API Endpoints
The application exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

1. **Initialize Event**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /initialize`
   - **Description**: Initializes a new event with a given number of tickets.
   - **Request Body**:

     }

3. **Cancel Booking**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /cancel`

       "userId": "string"
     }

       "waitingListCount": "number"
     }
     ```
